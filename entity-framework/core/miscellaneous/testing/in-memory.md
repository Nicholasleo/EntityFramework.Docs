# Using the EF in-memory database to test an EF Core application

> [!WARNING]
> The in-memory database often behaves differently than common relational databases.
> Only use the in-memory database after fully understanding the issues and trade-offs involved, as discussed in [Testing code that uses EF Core](xref:core/miscellaneous/testing/index).  

> [!TIP]
> SQLite can use in-memory databases.
> Consider using this for testing to more closely match common relational database behaviors.
> This is covered in [Using SQLite to test an EF Core application](xref:core/miscellaneous/testing/sqlite).
